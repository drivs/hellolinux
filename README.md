# Welcome to The Linux workshop!

For starters, open up a terminal and type this:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/drivs/hellolinux 
```

This should work out of the box on both Linux and MacOS. This command will
*clone* the repository named *hellolinux* from github and down to your personal
machine. This repository will give us starting ground to work with linux.

The acutal guide is in *guide.md*
